\section{The origins: SELF Debugging}
%SELF needs aggressive optimizations to have reasonable performance. 
%But that prevents from debugging
%Hence OSR enables selective deoptimization at runtime, which provides source level information 
%That makes some optimizations not available since they are hard to undo (e.g. tail %recursion elimination)
%Scope descriptors enable mapping between optimized and unoptimized, enables to keep track %of the position in the virtual call tree etc. (will be detailed). 
%Interrupt points (where, why, how)
%Function invalidation
The SELF programming language is a pure object-oriented programming language.
SELF relies on a pure message-based model of computation that, while enabling high expressiveness and rapid prototyping, impedes the languages performances(CITE from self paper).
Therefore, the language's implementation depends on a set of aggressive optimizations to achieve good performances\cite{holzle1992debugging}.
SELF provides an interactive environment, based on interpreter semantics at compiled-code speed performances.\\

Providing source level code interactive debugging is hard in the presence of optimizations.
Single stepping or obtaining values for certain source level variables might not be possible.
For a language such as SELF, that heavily relies on aggressive optimizations, implementing a source code level debugger requires new techniques.\\

In \citetitle{holzle1992debugging}\cite{holzle1992debugging}, the authors came up with a new mechanism that enables to dynamically de-optimize code at specific interrupt points in order to provide source code level debugging while preserving expected behaviour (CITE from holzle).\\

\citean{holzle1992debugging} present the main challenges encountered to provide debugging behaviours, due to the optimizations performed by the SELF compiler. 
Displaying the stack according to a source-level view is impeded by optimizations such as inlining, register allocation and copy propagation.
For example, when a function is inlined at a call spot, only a single activation frame is visible, while the source level code expects to see two of them.
Figure (FIG), taken from \cite{holzle1992debugging}, provides another example of activations discordances between physical and source-level stacks.
In this figure, the source-level stack contains activations that were inlined by the compiler. For example, the activation B is inlined into A', hence disappearing from the physical stack.\\
\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/Figure1}
\decoRule
\caption[physical vs. source-level stacks]{Displaying the stack, figure from \cite{holzle1992debugging}.}
\end{figure}

Single-stepping is another important feature for a debugger. 
It requires to identify and execute the next machine instruction that corresponds to the source operation.
\citean{holzle1992debugging} highlights the impact of code motion and instruction scheduling on the machine instruction layout. 
Such optimizations re-order, merge, intersperse and sometimes delete source-level operations, therefore preventing a straight forward implementation of single-stepping for the debugger.\\

Compiler optimizations prevent dynamic changes from being performed in the debugger.
Holzle(CITE) identifies two separate issues: changing variable values, and modifying procedures (i.e., functions).
To illustrate the first case, Holzle CITE relies on an example where a variable is assigned the sum of two other variables.
The compiler identifies the two variables as being constants and replaces the addition by a direct constant assignment.
A debugger that allows to change variable values at run time would then yield a non correct behaviour if the user modifies one of the two variables. 
This problem does not arise in the case of unoptimized code since the addition is still present. 
For procedures, Holzle CITE describes an example where a function has been inlined by the compiler, but redefined by the user in the debugger.\\

Holzle(CITE) distinguishes two possible states for compiled code: \textit{optimized}, which can be suspended at widely-spaced interrupt points, from which we can reconstruct source-level state, and \textit{unoptimized}, that can be suspended at any source-level operation and is not subjected to any of the above debugging restrictions.\\

In order to deoptimize code on demand, SELF debugger needs to recover the unoptimized state that corresponds to the current optimized one. 
To do so, it relies on a special data structure, called a \textit{scope descriptor}. 
The scope descriptors are generated during compilation for each source-level scope. 
This data structure holds the scope place in the virtual call tree of the physical stack frame and records locations and values of its argument and local variables. 
It further holds locations or value of its subexpressions. Along with the scope descriptor, the compiler generates a mapping between virtual (i.e, scope descriptor and source position within the scope) and physical program counters (PC).
Figure \ref{Holzle2} is taken from CITE and displays a method suspended at two different points. 
At time t1, the stack trace from the debugger displays frame B, hiding the fact that B was inlined inside of A.
At time t2, D is called by C which is called by A, hence, the debugger displays 3 virtual stack frames instead of only one physical frame.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/Figure2}
\decoRule
\caption[Recovering the source-level state]{Recovering the source-level state (from CITE).}
\label{Holzle2}
\end{figure}


The de-optimization process follows 5 steps described in CITE and summed up here:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Save the physical stack frame and remove it from the run time stack.
    \item Determine the virtual activations in the physical one, the local variables and the virtual PC.
    \item Generate completely unoptimized compiled methods an physical activations for each virtual one.
    \item Find the unique new physical PC for each virtual activation and initialise (e.g., return addresses and frame pointers) the physical activations created in the previous step.
    \item Propagate the values for all elements from the optimized to the unoptimized activations.
\end{enumerate}

Holzle(CITE) also describes \textit{lazy deoptimization}, a technique to deoptimize a stack frame that is not at the current top of the execution stack. 
Lazy deoptimization defers the deoptimization transformation until control is about to return into the frame, hence enabling deoptimization for any frame located on the stack.\\

Deoptimization at any instruction boundary is hard. 
It requires to be able to recover the state at every single point of the program.
Holzle (CITE) relies on a weaker easier restrictions by enabling deoptimization only at certain points called \textit{interrupt points}. 
At an interrupt point, the program state is guaranteed to be consistent. 
The paper (CITE) defines two kinds of interrupt points: method prologues, and backward branches (i.e., end of loop bodies).
Holzle(CITE) therefore estimates the length of the longest code sequence that cannot be interrupted to be a few dozen of instruction, i.e., the average length of a code sequence that does not contain neither a call nor a loop end.
Interrupt points are also inserted at all possible run time errors to allow better debugging of synchronous events such as arithmetic overflow. 
The generated debugging information are needed only at interrupt points, which reduces the space used to support basic debugger operations (as opposed to allowing interrupts at any instruction boundary).\\

Providing a debugger for SELF limits the set of optimizations that the compiler can support, and decreases the performances of the program when the execution is resumed. 
Tail recursion elimination saves stack space by replacing a function call with a goto instruction, while fixing the content of registers.
SELF debugger is unable to reconstruct the stack frames eliminated by this optimization and hence, it is not implemented in the SELF compiler.
More generally, tail call elimination is one important limitation for the SELF debugger.

The debugger slows down the execution when the user decides to resume. 
The execution should proceed at full speed, but some stack frames might have been unoptimized, hence implying that a few frames might run slowly right after resuming execution.\\

\section{OSR \& VMs}
Virtual machines are privileged environments in which On-Stack replacement can be used to its full power.
As seen in \ref{WhyOSRInteresting}, OSR is as useful as the compiler's profiler is efficient.
A virtual machine (VM) has control over the resources allocation, enables to control the code that is generated by the compiler, and maintains important run time data, state information, and other useful informations about the program being executed.\\

This section presents several examples of VMs that support On-Stack replacement. 
The section is divided into two parts: we first presents several solutions that provide OSR for  the Java programming language, then we briefly introduce LLVM virtual machine, a virtual machine presenting an interesting framework in which we believe On-Stack replacement mechanism should fit.\\ 
\subsection{HotSpot}

The Java HotSpot Performance Engine(CITE web) is a Java virtual machine developed and maintained by Oracle.
The Java HotSpot VM provides features such as a class loader, a bytecode interpreter, Client and Server virtual machines, several garbage collectors, just-in-time compilation and adaptive optimizations.\\

The Java HotSpot Engine supports on-stack replacement in order to provide efficient deoptimization\cite{paleczny2001java}.
When a class loading invalidates an optimization decision, such as a call inlining, the methods relying on this decision need to be deoptimized.
Threads that are executing in a method that needs to be deoptimized are stopped as soon as they reach a safepoint.
The JVM state is recorded as an input of safepoints and procedure calls.
This implies, as a side effect, that the entire JVM state is marked as "live" at a safepoint, hence extending the live range of some values.
The Java HotSpot Engine then extracts the native frame corresponding to this execution trace, and converts it into a byte code interpreter frame.
The execution of the method then continues in the interpreter.
UNCOMMON TRAPS\\

\subsection{Jikes RVM}

The Jikes Research Virtual Machine (RVM)(REF) is an open source, self hosted, i.e., it is entirely implemented in Java, virtual machine for Java programs.
%TODO compile only from Qian.
It provides advanced state-of-the-art features such as dynamic compilation, adaptive optimizations, garbage collection, thread scheduling, and synchronization (CITE).\\

Jikes RVM is an extensible framework in which different On-Stack replacement techniques have been implemented.
%The first
\citean{fink2003design} implemented OSR support in JikesRVM. 
Their implementation relies on JVM scope descriptor, associated to method activation frames.
A scope descriptor contains the thread running the activation, the bytecode index that corresponds to the program counter, values of all local and stack locations, and a reference to the activation's stack frame.
The OSR transition is divided into three steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extract the compiler-independent state from a suspended thread. 
    \item Generate the new code for the suspended activation.
    \item Transfer the execution in the suspended thread to a new compiled code.
\end{enumerate}
\citean{fink2003design} generates the target function by compiling a specialized version of the method for each activation that is replaced, as well as a new version for future invocations.
In other words, instead of allowing multiple entry points per function \cite{lameed2013modular, paleczny2001java}, this JikesRVM OSR implementation generates a specialized version of the target function that has only one entry point, corresponding to the instruction from which the OSR transition was triggered.
Each such method contains a special \textit{prologue}, responsible for saving values into locals and loading values on the stack.
OSR transitions can be taken at special points, called \textit{OSR points}, introduced by the optimizing compiler and that correspond to points where the running activation may be interrupted.
The implementation makes a distinction between unconditional and conditional OSR points.
An OSR point is implemented as call that takes all live variables as arguments. 
This constraints some optimizations such as dead code elimination, load elimination, store elimination and code motion by extending the liveness scope of some variables.
An OSR point transfers control to an exit block, i.e., it can be viewed as a non-return call.\\

\citean{soman2006efficient} proposed a general-purpose OSR mechanism, for JikesRVM, that presents less restrictions for compiler optimizations than the previous approach, while decoupling the OSR implementation from the optimization process.
They extend the previous OSR implementation\cite{fink2003design} to enable OSR transition at, and accross points at which the execution can be suspended.
In order to do so, they rely on a special data structure called a \textit{variable map}(VARMAP).
A VARMAP is associated with each method, and consists in a list of thread-switching points and their live variables.
When the compiler performs optimizations, the VARMAP is updated accordingly.
Once the compilation completes, the VARMAP is compressed into a compressed map that contains an entry for each OSR point present in the method. EXPAND ON HOW OSR IS PERFORMED.
\citean{soman2006efficient} also propose an alternative lazy triggering of on-stack replacement.
Lazy triggering consists in taking an OSR transition due to events in the environment, i.e., events triggered by the runtime. 
Whenever the runtime deems an assumption invalide, it invokes a helper function called \textit{OSR helper} that either patches the code of the executing methods to call the OSR process, or it modifies return addresses of the callees of the method to be replaced to point to the OSR helper.
When a callee returns, the OSR helper creates a new stack frame with the state extracted from the specialized method's stack and saves all of the specialized method registers into its stack frame. 
The return address of the OSR helper points to the current instruction in the specialized code, which is then used during OSR to identify the location to resume the execution in the new version of the method.
Lazy triggering improves the code efficiency by avoiding the extra cost of guards evaluations.\\

\subsection{WebKit VM}
OSR has been implemented in LLVM in several projects, such as the WebKit web browser engine and the MCJit project.
In WebKit, OSR and LLVM are part of the four-tier architecture compiler for JavaScript.
The Fourth-Tier LLVM (FTL) is an LLVM-based Just-In-Time compiler.
The WebKit run-time compilation flow is described by Figure \ref{FTL}.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/FTL}
\decoRule
\caption[The WebKit FTL]{The WebKit Four-tier optimization flow.}
\label{FTL}
\end{figure}
 
Forward arrows represent \textit{OSR entries}, i.e., a transformation that yields a more optimized version of the code at run-time.
Backward arrows correspond to \textit{OSR exits}, i.e., a transformation that yields a less optimized version of the code at run-time.
The low level interpreter (LLInt) is used for low latency start up.
The baseline JIT generates WebKit bytecode with no optimization enabled.
The transition from the first tier to the second one happens when a statement is executed more than a hundred times or a function is called more than six times.
The data flow graph (DFG) JIT is triggered when a statement executes more than a thousand times or a function is called more than sixty-six times.
The FTL tier relies on LLVM machine code optimizations to generate a fast version of portions of the code.
In order to hide the costs of the translation to LLVM IR and its compilation time, the FTL is triggered only for long running portions of the code that are currently executing.
There are two kinds of transitions in WebKit: the ones contained entirely inside the WebKit framework (i.e., transitions 1,2 \& 4 in Figure \ref{FTL}), and the ones that involve LLVM (i.e., 3 \& 5 in Figure \ref{FTL}).\\

Transitions to and from LLVM are hard. 
There is no control over the stack layout or the optimized code produced by LLVM.
In the case of transition 3, a different LLVM version is generated for each entry point that the framework desires to have inside this function.
In WebKit, such entry points are located at loop headers. 
This choice makes sense with regard to the condition to enter the FTL, i.e., transition 3 is taken for long running portions of code that could be improved thanks to LLVM low level optimizations.
WebKit has to generate a different version for each entry points for two main reasons: LLVM allows only single entry points to functions (going around this limitation would require to modify LLVM IR and implementation), and instrumenting a function with several entry points would impact on the quality and performance of the generated native code by extending the code's length and restricting code motion.\\

Performing transition 3 requires to get the current state of execution and identify the entry point corresponding to the current instruction being executed.
The DFG dumps its state into a scratch buffer.
An LLVM function with the correct entry point is then generated, and instrumented such that its first block loads the content of the scratch buffer and correctly reconstructs the state.
The mapping between the DFG IR nodes and the LLVM IR values is straight forward since both IR's are in SSA.
A special data structure, called a Stackmap, enables to keep the mapping between LLVM values and registers/spill-slots.\\

Transition 5 is harder as it requires to extract the execution state from LLVM.
WebKit has two different mechanisms to enables OSR exits: the exit thunk and the invalidation points.
In the first case, WebKit introduces exit branches at OSR exit points.
The branch is guarded by an OSR exit condition and is a no-return tail call to a special function that takes all the live non-constant and not accounted for bytecode values.
The second mechanism enables to remove the guard.
Since we assume that the portion of code that is instrumented is executed a lot of times, the cost of testing the condition can have a great impact on the overall execution time.
This mechanism relies on a special LLVM intrinsics, namely patchpoints and stackmap shadow bytes.
A patchpoint enables to reserve some extra space in the code, filled with nop sleds. 
When the WebKit framework detects that an exit should be taken, it overwrites the nop sleds with the correct function call to perform the OSR exit.
This breaks the optimized version of the code which cannot be re-used later on and must be collected.
The stackmap shadow bytes improves on this technique by allowing to directly overwrite the code, without having any nop sled generated before hand.

WebKit is a project that heavily, and successfully relies on OSR to improve performances.
The web browser engine is used in Apple Web browser Safari and enables a net improvement of performances why proving to be reliable(CITE?).
Although successful, it does not provide a general and reusable framework for OSR in LLVM that other projects could reuse.\\

\section{OSR \& LLVM}
\subsection{What is LLVM?}
%TODO cite the llvm paper?
LLVM is a compiler infrastructure providing a set of reusable libraries.
LLVM provides the middle layers of a compiler system and a large set of optimizations for compile-time, link-time, run-time, and idle-time for arbitrary programming languages.
These optimizations are performed on an intermediate representation (IR) of the code and yield an optimized IR.
The LLVM framework also provides tools to convert and link code into machine dependent assembly code for a specific target platform.
LLVM supports several instruction sets including ARM, MIPS, AMD TeraScale, and x86/x86-64(CITE?).\\

The LLVM intermediary representation is a language-independent set of instructions that also provides a type system.
The LLVM IR is in static single assignment form (SSA), which requires every variable every variable to be defined before it is used and assigned exactly once. 
SSA enables or improves several compiler optimizations among which constant propagation, value range propagation, sparse conditional constant propagation, dead code elimination, global value numbering, partial redundancy elimination, strength reduction and register allocation.
The SSA requirement for variables to be assigned only once requires a special mechanism, called a $\phi$-node, one a value depends on which control flow branch was executed before reaching the current variable definition.
Figure \ref{SSA example} provides an example where we have to choose between two possible values for a variable after the merging of two control flow branches.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/SSAForm}
\decoRule
\caption[SSA example]{Example of $\phi$-node in SSA form.}
\label{SSA example}
\end{figure}

%TODO exhaustive basic types?
The LLVM IR type system provides basic types (e.g., integers, floats), and five derived types: pointers, arrays, vectors, structures, and functions.
Any type construct can then be represented as a combination of these types.\\

%TODO reformulate/restructure this §
The LLVM framework is a versatile tool that enables to implement many programming languages paradigms.
LLVM compilers exist for several mainstream/popular languages such as Java, Python, Objective-C, and Ruby have an LLVM compiler.
Other languages, like Haskell, Scala, Swift, Rust, Ada, and Fortran also have an LLVM compiler implementation.
LLVM basic types enable to support object-oriented languages, such as Java and Python, dynamically typed languages like R or statically typed like Scala.
LLVM also enables to model functional languages such as Haskell, as well as imperative ones. 
Furthermore, it supports reflection and, thanks to dynamic linking, modular languages (e.g., Haskell).
The tools provided enable static compilation as well as dynamic compilation techniques such as Just-In-Time compilation (JIT).\\

\subsection{Why do we want OSR in LLVM?}

On-Stack replacement high-level mechanism is language-independent.
Therefore, implementing OSR as a clean modular addition to LLVM would enable developers to leverage this feature in many programming languages, without requiring them to write a new compiler from scratch.
Furthermore, as explained in \ref{WhyOSRInteresting}, OSR is a useful tool for dynamic and adaptative optimizations.
LLVM already provides implementations for many compiler optimizations(CITE) and tools to allow dynamic recompilation of code.
Developers can therefore focus on language specific challenges, such as efficient profilers and new speculative systems, rather than on the optimizations and OSR implementations.

Implementing OSR for LLVM not only serves several languages, but also allows to provide a solution for several target platforms.
As explained previously, LLVM supports several instructions sets corresponding to different architectures.
By implementing OSR in LLVM, we get portability among these platforms for free.\\

\subsection{OSR as an LLVM library: the MCJIT OSR implementation}
The MCJIT OSR support(CITE) is an attempt at providing an OSR library compatible with the standard LLVM implementation.
Lameed \& Hendren claim to have come up with a clean modular, and re-usable technique completely defined at the LLVM IR level and compatible with the standard LLVM distribution.
There implementation answers to five challenges, listed in the paper CITE and that we reproduce here:\\ 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identifying correct interrupt points and using the current LLVM IR to represent them.
    \item Using the LLVM tools to correctly transform the IR while preserving a correct control flow graph. 
    \item Making a new version of a function available at the same address as the old one.
    \item Providing a clean API for the OSR library, that is compatible with LLVM's inlining capabilities.
    \item Integrating OSR without modifying the LLVM installation.
\end{enumerate}

The paper (CITE) claims to support optimization and re-optimization, as well as de-optimization by going back to the previous version of the function.
Figure \ref{OSR classification} shows that this feature only allows single-steps to be taken, i.e., the OSR library implemented in CITE does not seem to allow to skip intermediary versions.\\

The MCJit library that provides OSR functionalities fit into the regular JIT infrastructure provided by LLVM as described in Figure \ref{MCJitArchitecture} taken from CITE.

\end{figure}
The left figure is a normal JIT in LLVM. 
The LLVM CodeGen is the front-end of the compiler infrastructure that generates the LLVM IR.
The LLVM Optimizer contains a collection of transformations and optimizations that run on LLVM IR. 
The Target CodeGen outputs the machine code corresponding to the LLVM IR input. 
The MCJit OSR API instruments the LLVM CodeGen to insert OSR points where the OSR transition can be triggered. 
A point is a call to the genOSRSignal function, which takes as arguments a pointer to a code transformer responsible for generating the new version of the function.
The code transformer takes as arguments a pointer to the function that needs to be transformed, and a special OSR label to identify which OSR points triggered the call, if the function contains several ones.
The OSR pass is responsible for instrumenting OSR points with the correct OSR machinery.
The instrumentation saves the live values and creates a descriptor that contains four elements: 
%TODO explain the control version better
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A pointer to the current version of the function. 
    \item A pointer to the control version of the function, i.e., a copy of the old version of the function.
    \item A variable mapping between the original version and the control version.
    \item The set of live variables at the OSR points. 
\end{enumerate}\\

Figures \ref{BaseCFG}, \ref{InsertCFG}, and \ref{OSRPassCFG} give an example of OSR instrumentation at a loop header.
LH1 is the loop header. 
LB is the body of the loop and LE the loop exit. 
Figure \ref{BaseCFG} control flow graph (CFG) is the original CFG. 
Figure \ref{InsertCFG} is the resulting CFG after the Inserter is executed.
Figure \ref{OSRPassCFG}'s CFG corresponds to the result of the OSR pass.
The \textit{recompile} call in the OSR block recompiles \textit{f} using the correct code transformer.
Then \textit{f} calls itself, executing the new version of the function.
This works since the new version lives at the same address as the previous one and is instrumented to jump to the correct instruction, i.e., the one corresponding to the current point at which OSR was triggered.
Figure \ref{FCFG} represents the CFG of \textit{f} before the OSR instrumentation.
Figure \ref{InstFCFG} shows the instrumentation of \textit{f} that enables to jump to the correct instruction in the middle of the function. 
A prolog entry block is inserted at the function header.
This block checks the \textit{OSR flag} to know if an OSR transition is being performed.
If that is the case, it branches to the prolog block that restores the state before resuming the execution at the correct instruction.\\

%TODO critic of the paper.
The OSR implementation proposed in CITE presents interesting features.
The implementation is done entirely at the LLVM IR, hence making it language-independent.
Furthermore, since the transformation function is provided by the user, any kind of language specific transformation can be used during the OSR.
As a result, MCJit OSR support is an interesting modular OSR library.

On the other hand, this library does not allow to have several versions of the same function, live at the same time.
This restriction can impede the overall performance of the program by extending the scope in which an assumption on which we base the transformation must hold.
For example, a portion of the code, call it \textit{A}, can trigger an OSR, while portion \textit{B} is such that the assumption on which the optimization is based does not hold.
The choice that the user has is to either optimize for A, and deoptimize for B, or to prevent A from optimizing by enlarging the scope in which the assumption is supposed to hold.
None of these solutions is good if \textit{A} and \textit{B} are executed many times, one after the other.
We will either lose a lot of execution time performing OSR, or keep executing \textit{A} without optimization.

In the paper, the deoptimization process is not described. 
It is implied that it relies on the same set of tools provided by the framework as the optimization process, but no example is provided.
As explained in \ref{WhyOSRInteresting}, deoptimization is the most interesting feature of OSR, as it is required to preserve correctness.
Being able to identify where a function should exit is a hard task.
The MCJit library does not provide tools to ease this process and leaves the responsibility to the developer to instrument his functions correctly in order to exit to the correct landing pad.

To the best of our knowledge, MCJit OSR library is not currently used in production or any important project.
As mentioned earlier, WebKit is efficiently integrated in Apple Safari's web browser, which provides useful feedback on its performances.
The lack of usage of MCJit OSR library prevents us from collecting performance results and assess its efficiency.
Furthermore, the experimental evaluation in CITE relies on an example that seems artificial for our use of OSR. 
The case study presents a dynamic inliner that decides to inline a function call if the function is less than 20 basic blocks long, or if it is less than 50 basic blocks long and has an interpreter environment associated with its body. 
This requirement for inlining is one that can be checked statically and, hence, seems a little artificial.\\

\section{A classification summary}
%TODO some kind of sum up and comparison, related to what we had in chapter 2.
